                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Washington grew up in Virginia on a farm. As a teenager,
                    he worked as a land surveyor.
                    Early in his life he lead the Virginia militia and fought in the French and Indian War.
                    These early experiences gave him leadership skills that he would use later in life.
